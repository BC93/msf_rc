MSF recon script

# Description:
does not use any metasploit modules, only the database. This script is for the OSCP exam


the nse scripts are not my own, they are from nmaps nse lib, I only have them added for organization, ease of use.


you'll need to change the nse_dir variable to the local directory you have yours stored in, as I doubt you have your programs organized the same way as me.


# project plan
tbd.
